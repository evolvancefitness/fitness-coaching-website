      <h3>Meet Oliver:</h3>
      <p>
        There was a time when I wasn’t proud of the person I saw in the mirror — physically, mentally, emotionally. I felt stuck, frustrated, like I was falling short of the potential I knew I had but didn’t know how to reach.
        I’ve spent months in wilderness therapy, miles from comfort, stripped down to nothing but my own mind. I’ve done the inner work most people spend a lifetime avoiding — not because I wanted to, but because I had to. 
        And through all of it, I learned how to face the hard stuff head-on: the self-doubt, the unhealthy patterns, the fear of becoming nothing more than what others expected of me.
        <br><br>
        Evolvance was born from that fire — from the belief that real strength comes from the inside out. Through fitness, mindset training, and deep personal growth, I rebuilt myself. And now I help others do the same.
        <br><br>
        This isn’t about perfect bodies or Instagram aesthetics. It’s about reclaiming your power. It’s about becoming someone you’re proud to be. So if you're lost, angry, numb, or just tired of where you are — I get it. 
        And I’ll meet you there. Then I’ll help you build something better. 
        <strong>Let’s evolve.</strong>

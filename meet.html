        I'm not just a coach — I'm someone who understands the fear of falling short, of wasting potential. 
        Evolvance was born from that very place. I know what it’s like to feel stuck — physically, mentally, emotionally — 
        and what it takes to break out of it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Through fitness, mindset work, and discipline, I transformed my own life. Now I help others do the same — not with quick fixes, 
        but with real, lasting change. This isn’t about looking good for a moment — it’s about evolving into the strongest version of yourself, for life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re starting from square one or chasing the next level, I’m here to guide you every step of the way.
